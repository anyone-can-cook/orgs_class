# Short answers

4 points each

Answer each of the following questions in 2-5 sentences:

<!-- your comment 

1.	According to resource dependence theory, why does organizational mission change when an organization switches from relying on one resource to relying on a different resource [consider both internal and external power dynamics]. Give an example.
-->
1. What is an "organizational field" from new/neo-institutional theory? Imagine it is one year from today. You are beginning an empirical research project motivated by the question, "why (or why not) did UCLA change its policy about investments and investment disclosure in response to the Palestine Solidarity student movement?" Who are the relevant groups of actors in the organizational field that are salient to this question? Usually, good empirical case studies focus on the actions/interactions of a small number of actors, while other relevant groups are given a secondary/supporting role (otherwise the project becomes an ocean wide or an inch deep). Which two or three groups of actors would you focus your research on and why these groups?
1. Prestige is a resource valued by research universities. UC-Berkeley (UCB) and UC-San Diego (UCSD) are both highly ranked (US News and other rankings systems) universities and both have highly ranked political science departments. Imagine these two political science departments have the same rank (i.e., they are tied) in US News and World Report Grad School Rankings, but UCB has more highly ranked departments than UCSD, and UCB is a more highly ranked university as a whole than UC-San Diego. According to resource dependence theory, which is likely to be greater: (a) the influence of UCB political science department over organizational decision-making within UCB or (b) the influence of UCSD political science department over organizational decision-making within UCSD? Why?


# Essay


Answer the following essay prompt. Essay is worth 67 points [sorry not a very round number!]. Can place your essay at the end of this word document.

1. Develop the conceptual framework for a research question about a topic of your choosing by doing the following in some order: (A) state a research question on a topic of your choosing (one sentence); (B) provide brief background information (e.g., one paragraph) on the topic to acquaint the reader; (C) develop a conceptual framework to address this research question that is based on one theoretical perspective (e.g., new institutional theory) or that integrates two theoretical perspectives; (D) close by discussing the sort of data you think would be most appropriate for answering the research question. 
    - On the conceptual framework
      - this is the heart of the essay, probably two-thirds of text.
      - Whatever theory(s) you choose, first lay out what the theory says, focusing on ideas/concepts that are most relevant to your study and show how these ideas/concepts are applied to your study
      - The conceptual framework should lay out -- based on theory -- which actors/relationships/processes the research should pay attention to
      - guidelines from google docs about conceptual frameworks will be helpful
        - look for github issues with the label "craft"
    - On the discussion of data source(s):
      - Here, try to minimize research methodology jargon. 
      - Rather, speak plainly about why you think a particular data source(s) are useful for the sorts of actors/relationships/processes deemed important by the theories you are drawing from, why this data source would yield credible insights about the issue (e.g., be wary that administrators expert in public relations spin), and whether the data source could realistically be obtained.
    - On choice of theory(s) for your conceptual framework
      - At least one of the theories, must be a theoretical perspective from this class (e.g., garbage can theory, old institutionalism, scholarship from sociology of race)
      - *Recommendation*: choose at least one theory that speaks to the *actions*/*behaviors* of actors you think are important for your research (e.g., by itself, "whiteness as property" doesn't tell you how trustees will respond to demands by politicians to ban CRT).


## Essay guidelines and recommendations

- Guidelines
  - Essay should be three to four pages (excluding references) double space, size 11 or 12 font, one inch margins all around
    - A bit less than three pages is fine, but cannot be longer than four pages
  - Follow APA style
    - Use citations when appropriate
    -	Any verbatim text from another source MUST be cited and quoted; failure to do this will be considered plagiarism and will result in no credit for the essay
- Recommendations on theory
  -	Whenever you use a particular theoretical concept (e.g., "cooptation"), define the concept in general terms before you apply the concept to the particular question at hand
    - And when applying this concept to a case, state how the concept is being operationalized in the case/issue being studied
  -	Be selective about which elements of theory your essay focuses on
    - Breadth is often the enemy of depth
      - Just as in good empirical scholarship, a good essay should develop deep insight rather than be “an ocean wide but an inch deep” [my most common critique on journal manuscripts I reject]
    - A useful approach can be to provide a short, broad overview of the theory (e.g., 2-3 sentences) and then devote more substantial amount of space to discussing theoretical ideas/concepts that are most relevant to the case or focus of the essay
  - When applying theory to analyze a case, be selective about which actors/relationships from the case that your essay focuses on (e.g., can say something like "many important factors in this case/issue like X, Y, and Z, but my essay is going to focus on W and V").
- Recommendations on writing
  - Create an outline to develop logical flow of ideas/argument
  - Strive for clear language that presents your ideas as simply as possible
  - Each paragraph should be about one idea/topic (could be big or small)
  - First sentence ["topic sentence"] of paragraph should tell reader what paragraph is
  about
  - Subsequent sentences flesh out the idea of topic sentence, develop logical
  argument and/or empirical evidence
  - Avoid introducing entirely new topics halfway through the paragraph. This confuses the reader and undermines the logical argument/evidence the paragraph is building. If you want to introduce a new idea, start a new paragraph.

####### UNIVERSITY TIES TO POLICE

Group 3: Police Racial Profiling and Brutality on Campus 
Students are calling for universities to cut their contracts with city and state police forces in the wake of campus police brutality during Black Lives Matter demonstrations and mental health crises. Students call for university administration to reinvest their budget to repair the harm police violence has caused to their community, especially students of color. In addition, they ask the university to partner with them to educate and organize students and faculty on the harm of carceral systems and focus on community care.

<!-- Previous essay prompts

The "Combahee River Collective" was a Black feminist organization best known for publishing the 1977 _Combahee River Collective Statement_, which became an important document in the development of Black feminism [@RN4570]. @RN869 develop an old institutionalism analysis of the origins and institutionalization of the "terminal vocational education" mission of the community college. Your task is, first, to develop an old institutionalism analysis of the origins and institutionalization of the _Combahee River Collective Statement_. Next, apply selected ideas/concepts from Black feminism – from Combahee River Collective Statement or other Black feminist scholarship you have read – to your analysis. Discuss how this application of Black feminism overcomes limitations of the old institutionalism analysis or yields insights that would difficult to observe in an analysis that only utilized old institutionalism.


•	Describe core ideas/concepts of old institutionalism. Analyze the events described in Hevel (2017) from an old institutionalism perspective. How could concepts from queer theory be incorporated to strengthen this analysis?
Hevel, M. S. (2017). Toward a history of LGBT student organizations' struggle-for-recognition lawsuits: The exemplar of GLSA v. Gohn.


4.	“Institutionalization projects” are conscious efforts by a well-organized group of actors to change macro-level institutions that affect entire fields or professions (as opposed to organization-level institutions).  Analysis of institutionalization projects often incorporate elements of “old” and “new” institutional theory. Old institutionalism is relevant because it highlights agency of “institutional agents”, status-group mobilization/coalition-building, strategizing, etc. necessary to change institutions. New institutionalism is relevant because the goal is change what the field defines as legitimate/appropriate and because institutional agents may attempt to achieve their goals by harnessing the mechanisms of coercive, mimetic, or normative isomorphism (especially if the “field” is organized around a small number of professional associations).  The term “neo-institutional theory” refers to the integration of elements of old and new institutionalism. Consider the ASHE Presidential speech by Shaun Harper as part of a broader institutionalization project to change the field of higher education research (e.g., what topics are legitimate, how should curriculum in higher education programs be changed, how should research quality be defined, which actors are most influential in determining allocation of resources, etc.).  Your task: use selected elements of old and new institutionalism to (1) analyze the strategies you observed in the ASHE presidential speech and (2) make recommendations about strategies/actions that would increase the success of this institutionalization project.  OPTIONALLY, describe any limitations of neo-institutional theory with respect to making helpful recommendations about this institutionalization project.

3.	Imagine that you are a consultant that has been hired to provide advice to the dean of a college of education at a major public research university.  State appropriations to the university have declined in recent years and the university recently adopted a “responsibility center budget model” which means that every college must generate sufficient revenues to cover its costs.  The dean could not afford to hire new faculty when several senior professors retired and several others were poached by other universities.  A major donor who is pro-charter school approached the dean offering a $30 million gift to start a research/policy center focused on helping charter schools improve their performance. This funding would enable the dean to hire several new faculty (who study charter schools). The majority of faculty are opposed to charter schools. Leaders of local traditional public schools are also opposed to charter schools. The percent of local K-12 students attending charter schools increased from 15% to 30% in the last decade.  Your task is to analyze this issue and provide recommendations using two of the following three theoretical perspectives: garbage can decision-making theory, old institutionalism, resource dependence theory. Feel free to invent additional details but avoid inventing details that make the problem too simplistic (e.g., faculty will vote to terminate the dean if she creates the center).


##########################
On Friday, 2/29/2020 UC-Santa Cruz fired 54 graduate assistants who had gone on strike to demand a cost of living adjustment (COLA) (i.e., higher wages). Imagine that you are a consultant who has been hired by [you choose] either the University of California Office of the President (UCOP) *or* the United Auto Workers Local 2685, the union that represents all UC graduate students. Your task is to: (A) summarize the main ideas of Emerson (1962) and Pfeffer and Salancik (1978); (B) apply these ideas to analyze the conflict; and (C) drawing from your analysis, develop a few (e.g., 2-4) recommendations for actions your client should take as well as the rationale for these recommendations.

ADDITIONAL NOTES/HINTS

•	I have included a handful of short news stories/documents about this issue in CCLE
o	No need to do additional reading beyond these sources
o	Also, feel free to read selectively from this website created UC-Santa Cruz students https://payusmoreucsc.com/ [Thank you Katie!!!]
o	I am more interested in how apply theory to a case rather than you demonstrating that you know everything about the case


Integrate selected ideas/concepts from “Whiteness as Property” (Harris, 1993) with one other theoretical perspective we learned in class to analyze how/why the University of California Board of Regents will vote on the use of standardized tests (i.e., SAT, ACT) in the UC admissions process

ADDITIONAL NOTES/HINTS

•	Generally speaking, your essay should theoretical ideas/concepts, introduce relevant background information on the case, and then apply these ideas/concepts to analyze the case
•	Harris (1993) explicitly discusses conceptions of “merit” and the role of standardized tests in defining “merit”
•	I have included a handful of short news stories/documents about this issue in CCLE
o	No need to do additional reading beyond these sources
o	Note that several of them talk about the “UC Academic Council’s Standardized Testing Task Force” but no need to make that taskforce and their report a primary focus of your essay
