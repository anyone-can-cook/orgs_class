# Introduction

# Postmodern conceptions of power

## Foucault

Michel Foucault (1926-1984)

- French philosophy, historian of ideas, literary critic

<br>
Control in "traditional" vs. modern/contemporary society

- "Traditional" times
  - torture was very public, with goal of leaving violent imprint on the mind of onlookers
- Modern/contemporary society
  - control happens through creating the idea of "normality"
  - "human sciences"
    - develop foundations of knowledge that enable things to be categorized as normal or not
    - disciplinary/professional knowledge defines what is good/bad, what is sane/crazy, what counts as evidence
      - In _The order of things_ @RN1212 studies the development of psychiatry, and how psychiatry defined mental disorders
        - e.g., The book [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders](https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm)
- Foucault rejects the idea that reducing torture means we have become more "humane"
  - modern control forms are less violent on the body, but theyr are more invasive and more regular
  - one structure of punishment replaced by the next without any broad teleological purpose
  
<br>
Historical analysis

- Marx (building on Hegel) teleological view of history
  - "progress" of society is a process that proceeds in three stages of thesis, antithesis, synthesis
  - Marx focuses on: fudalism (thesis), capitalism (antithesis), communism (synthesis)
  - Need to progress through stages of thesis and antithesis to realize the need for the synthesis
- Foucault
  - rejects the idea of history as a series of developmental stages
  - rejects the enlightenment view that there is progress in history
  - the present is a contingent outcome, not a pre-ordained deterministic thing 

<br>
Power-knowledge

- disciplinary power: the human sciences
  - Psychiatry, medicine, demography, economics
- For Foucault knowledge does not liberate but makes domination more effective


<br>
Discourse (an essential term developed by Foucault)

- definition
  - "discourse" refers to the rules which allow certain statements to be judged as true or false
- For Foucault, there are no objective rules to say which statement is better than another; statements are only true within a discourse
  - e.g., submit a journal manuscript to an economics journal, reviewers will evaluate it based on the extent to which it competently defines and utilizes economic theory and method
  - submit the same manuscript to a journal of developmental psychology, it will be evaluated based on extent to which it competently defines and utilizes theory and method from developmental psychology
  
<br>
Power

- Conventional view of power within political sociology: 
  - power as a repressive force
    - For example, we will read @RN960, which defines power as the ability of actor _A_ to control the actions of actor _B_
  - Power located in key institutions (e.g., "the state")
- in contrast to view of power as repressive, Foucault focuses on "disciplinary power" as a productive force that functions by its ability to constitute an established foundation of knowledge that then has power in society
- in contrast to view of power being located in the state, Foucault posits a network of power that is a diffuse process occurring throughout the social body (e.g., different disciplines gain power to regulate different parts of the body)
  - Shifts analytical attention away from the central state
    - capillary power: micro networks through which which disciplinary power flows through
  - disicplinary power is agentless
  - Disciplinary power operates through defining certain practices as normal, and anyone who deviates from these practices as deviant.
- the "normalizing" power of knowledge
  - Sociologist Talcott Parsons believes that there is social order because people internalize norms
  - Foucault believes that disciplinary knowledge creates what is normal and what is not, and conceptions from these "expert authorities" becomes internalized
- On resistance, "a way out"
  - because disciplinary power operates through defining certain practices as normal, resistance is purposely deviating from the norm
  - Much of Foucault's work criticizes/unpacks "disciplinary knowlege" which defines what is normal, what is not, what is true, what is not
    - The critique of "disciplinary knowledge", seeing that those sources of disciplinary knowledge rely
on assumptions and that there are other foundational assumptions that would lead to different
conceptions of normal, this critique gives liberation.


When one discourse overtakes another discourse

- Disciplines, professional societies "turn" from one set of assumptions/beliefs to another, often because an organized coalition of actors engage in a successful coup of the dominant canon
  - the new discourse was motivated by a critique of the domination/violence from the previously ascendant discourse, 
- For Foucault, the replacing of one discourse is neither good nor bad
  - new discourse re-defines what is true, what is valued, what is normal/deviant
  - newly ascendant discourse values some devalues others in different ways such that "others" (whoever defined as deviant, not important) continue to be excluded
  
Discipline and Punish [@RN1230]

- Probably his most famous book, in which he developed some of the ideas described above
  - but I think it is useful to lay out the core ideas
